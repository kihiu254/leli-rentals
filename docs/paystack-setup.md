# Paystack Integration Setup

This guide will help you set up Paystack payments for Leli Rentals.

## What is Paystack?

Paystack is a payment gateway that supports multiple payment methods including:
- Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)
- Mobile Money (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, MTN Mobile Money)
- Bank Transfers
- USSD
- QR Code payments

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Paystack Account

1. Go to [Paystack](https://paystack.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Complete the verification process
4. Access your dashboard

### 2. Get API Keys

1. Go to Settings → Developers in your Paystack dashboard
2. Copy your **Public Key** and **Secret Key**
3. For testing, use the test keys (they start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add:

```bash
# Paystack Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_your_public_key_here
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
```

**Important Notes:**
- The public key starts with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` so it can be used in the browser
- The secret key should NOT have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for security
- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control

### 4. Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the pricing page: `/profile/billing`
3. Click on "Plans & Pricing" tab

   - **Success**: 4084084084084085
   - **Declined**: 4084084084084086
   - **Insufficient Funds**: 4084084084084087
